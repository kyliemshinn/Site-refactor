# Site-refactor

## Description
*In this project, I fixed the site to make it more accessible for the user and anyone who views the code for optimal search engines. This accounts for:

    - Adding in all semantic HTML elements
    - Fixing the line indentation throughout the HTML file
    - Condensing the style.css file and making it more readable/shorter
    - Fixed the sequential order of headings throughout the HTML files
    - Added alt attributes to all images within HTML file
    - Created a more relevant title for the website
    - Commented changes throughout the document for better understanding

potentially add picture of footer change and css change?
